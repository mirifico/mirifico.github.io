			<ul>
				<li class="p4">Recipients of a Bridging Visa E (BV E) <br>– usually people seeking protection who arrived by boat and have spent time in immigration detention facilities.</li>

			<p class="p3">Visa conditions may mean people cannot legally work, access Centrelink, Medicare or access other government assistance.
