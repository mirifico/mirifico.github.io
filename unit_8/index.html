			<p class="pstandout">Throughout 2016 Red Cross provided Emergency Relief support to more than 2,100&nbsp;people including those seeking protection, refugees and other migrants, in times of urgent need.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="art1">
			<p class="p4"><span>The Red Cross Emergency Relief Program was created in 2002 to provide support to people frequently at risk of poverty, malnutrition and social isolation.</span> </p>
			<p class="p1">_</p>
			<p class="p3">Since this vital program started, Red Cross staff and volunteers have assisted more than 12,000&nbsp;people across Australia.</p>
			<p class="p3">As the country’s only nationwide emergency relief provider specifically supporting migrants in crisis, Red Cross adapts the program to the urgent needs in each state and territory to deliver the support to people who need it most.</p>
			<p class="p3">Our Emergency Relief program provides vital insight into emerging vulnerabilities faced by people in the community.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p4">In 2016:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="p4">Red Cross provided assistance to more than 2,100 people in the form of financial and material support including food vouchers, basic household items, school supplies, medical expenses, accommodation support and support with utility bills.</li>
				<li class="p4">Deprivation of the ‘basics’ was the principle driver for people seeking emergency relief, representing the primary need in over half of all presentations.&#185;</li>
				<li class="p4">Financial costs associated with sending children to school or the supply of nappies and clothes for infants were issues for 40 percent of families we worked with.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p class="p3">The majority of people who sought support from Red Cross Emergency Relief in 2016 were people who had submitted a request for government support or people who had received an adverse decision regarding an application for protection and were struggling to meet their basic needs while awaiting the outcome.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p class="pfootnote">&#185;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food, clothing or transport support. This also includes material items that are essential to ensuring a safe and suitable living environment, such as blankets, bedding or baby items.</p>

		<div class="art2">
			<h2>Who accesses <br>Emergency Relief (ER)?</h2>
			<br>
			<p class="p4">Red Cross Migration Support Programs will provide ER support to anyone who becomes vulnerable as a result of migration.</p>
			<p class="p3">Our data shows that the majority of people who are accessing emergency relief through our program include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="p4">Recipients of a Bridging Visa E (BV E) – usually people seeking protection who arrived by boat and have spent time in immigration detention facilities.</li>
				<li class="p4">People who arrived by air with a valid visa and have then sought protection.</li>
				<li class="p4">People who have had an initial claim for protection refused and are having that decision reviewed in the Federal Circuit Court.</li>
				<li class="p4">People who are considered to be on a ‘return pathway’&#178; to their home countries.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p class="p3">Visa conditions may mean people cannot legally work, access Centrelink, Medicare or access other government assistance. Eligibility requirements for government assistance via the Status Resolution Support Services (SRSS) program are strict and there can be long waiting periods.</p> 
			<p class="p3">For those without a reliable source of alternative income and with no access to formal safety nets, the situation can become very serious, very quickly.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p class="pfootnote">&#178;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who have been determined by the Administrative Appeals tribunal as not meeting Australia’s protection obligations.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="art3">
			<h2>What support does Red Cross provide via Emergency Relief?</h2>
			<br>
			<p class="p4">Red Cross Emergency Relief helps to support the most vulnerable in the community by providing vouchers for essential items, material aid and one off cash payments.</p>
			<p class="p3">We organise referrals and transport assistance and support people to address their health needs.</p>
			<p class="p3">Some examples of Emergency Relief <br>Red Cross has provided include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="p4">Food packages to individuals and families who would otherwise go hungry in Western Australia.</li>
				<li class="p4">Donated household setup goods for a family in need or a refurbished bicycle to help an asylum seeker to be independent, self-reliant and healthy in Victoria.</li>
				<li class="p4">Cooking classes and gardening workshops to help with budgeting and healthy eating in South Australia.</li>
				<li class="p4">Transport vouchers to access English classes to help engage people in their communities in Northern Territory.</li>
				<li class="p4">Engaging dentists to donate their time to ensure dental health, or providing donated winter clothing, blankets and toys to children and families in New South Wales.</li>

		<div class="aside_1">
			<p class="pstandout">Red Cross has seen first-hand the positive impact on people who are able to actively engage in employment. Not only do their financial circumstances and quality of living improve, employment gives people greater self-confidence and sense of purpose and broadens their social connections in the community.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="art1">
			<h2>Who has work rights in Australia?</h2>
			<br>
			<p class="p4">Not all people seeking protection are allowed to work. Permission to work is dependent on how a person comes to Australia and the type of visa they held at the time of entry.</p>
			<p class="p3">Most people who arrived by boat and who are currently on a Bridging Visa are now granted permission to work. The right to work for other people with a Bridging Visa is dependent on the conditions of the visa they entered Australia with.</p>
			<p class="p3">If you came to Australia on a student visa and then could not return home due to a crisis in your home country, you’ll only be allowed to work 20 hours per week. If you came to Australia on a Visitor Visa, typically you will not be allowed to work.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="item1aspacerpane_row6">
			<p class="p1">_</p>
  		</div>

		<div class="art2">
			<h2>Even with work rights, <br>people still face barriers</h2>
			<br>
			<p class="p4">A number of people we supported through emergency relief indicated that they were experiencing work-related issues. Issues ranged from labour exploitation concerns to help obtaining employment separation certificates.</p>
			<p class="p3">For these reasons people can be at risk of becoming involved in unsafe work and exploitative relationships with employers exposing them to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="p4">unpaid or underpaid work;</li>
				<li class="p4">lengthy hours; and</li>
				<li class="p4">poor or unsafe work conditions.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p class="p3">Red Cross also supported people with referrals to trafficking support services.</p> 
			<p class="p3">Even with the right to work, migrants experience specific barriers to obtaining and maintaining their employment. Discrimination, difficulties having prior experience or education recognised, including a reluctance to hire people without local experience can be frustrating for people who are motivated to work.</p>
			<p class="p3">Denial of, or changes to, work rights and barriers to the employment market leads to reliance on income support payments and the charitable sector. The current amount of income support, 89 percent of an equivalent Centrelink benefit, situates people below the poverty line. As well as providing an income, work builds a person’s independence, provides stability and promotes participation in the community.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="art3">
			<h2>Participation Barriers</h2>
			<br>
			<p class="p4">The main barriers encountered, include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="p4">No formal recognition of qualifications gained, training or education achieved outside of Australia</li>
				<li class="p4">Inconsistent government policy on work rights</li>
				<li class="p4">Temporary visa conditions</li>
				<li class="p4">Lack of previous work experience in Australia</li>
				<li class="p4">Limited social connections that can link to potential employers</li>
				<li class="p4">Trauma (including post-traumatic stress), physical incapacity and mental health issues</li>
				<li class="p4">Carer duties/lack of extended family network</li>
				<li class="p4">Preventative cost of child care</li>
				<li class="p4">Language barriers</li>
				<li class="p4">Limited knowledge of recruitment channels</li>
				<li class="p4">Discrimination in recruitment or by employers</li>
				<li class="p4">Earlier immigration policy that prevented many people from working for several years</li>
				<li class="p4">Misinformation in the sector about who can legally work in Australia.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p class="p3">The Federal Government decision to grant work rights to most people living in the community, including people who arrived after 12 August 2012, was a welcome decision. However, many people have spent the last several years unemployed due to ineligibility to work, effectively limiting their capacity to gain local work experience. Many have had minimal access to English language classes — which has further compounded the barriers they face in attaining work.</p>

			<p class="pstandout2">&#147;This is a very difficult situation because I don’t want to ask for help from the same people every time. <br><br>If I am able to work, then I could be the one to provide money for my children, and rent, and food but I can’t work because I am not allowed to work.&#148;</p>
