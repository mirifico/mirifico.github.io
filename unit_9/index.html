				<p class="p4"><span>The Red Cross Emergency Relief Program was created in 2002 to provide support to people frequently at risk of poverty, malnutrition and social isolation.</span> </p>

				<p class="p4">Since this vital program started, Red Cross staff and volunteers have assisted more than 12,000&nbsp;people across Australia.</p>
				<p class="p3">As the country’s only nationwide emergency relief provider specifically supporting migrants in crisis, Red Cross adapts the program to the urgent needs in each state and territory to deliver the support to people who need it most.</p>
				<p class="p3">Our Emergency Relief program provides vital insight into emerging vulnerabilities faced by people in the community.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="p4">In 2016:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="p4">Red Cross provided assistance to more than 2,100 people in the form of financial and material support including food vouchers, basic household items, school supplies, medical expenses, accommodation support and support with utility bills.</li>
						<li class="p4">Deprivation of the ‘basics’ was the principle driver for people seeking emergency relief, representing the primary need in over half of all presentations.&#185;</li>
						<li class="p4">Financial costs associated with sending children to school or the supply of nappies and clothes for infants were issues for 40 percent of families we worked with.</li>
					</ul>
				<p class="p1">_</p>
				<p class="p3">The majority of people who sought support from Red Cross Emergency Relief in 2016 were people who had submitted a request for government support or people who had received an adverse decision regarding an application for protection and were struggling to meet their basic needs while awaiting the outcome.</p>
				<p class="p1">_</p>

				<h2>Who accesses <br>Emergency Relief (ER)?</h2>
				<p class="p1">_</p>
				<p class="p4">Red Cross Migration Support Programs will provide ER support to anyone who becomes vulnerable as a result of migration.</p>
				<p class="p3">Our data shows that the majority of people who are accessing emergency relief through our program include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="p4">Recipients of a Bridging Visa E (BV E) – usually people seeking protection who arrived by boat and have spent time in immigration detention facilities.</li>
						<li class="p4">People who arrived by air with a valid visa and have then sought protection.</li>
						<li class="p4">People who have had an initial claim for protection refused and are having that decision reviewed in the Federal Circuit Court.</li>
						<li class="p4">People who are considered to be on a ‘return pathway’&#178; to their home countries.</li>
					</ul>
				<p class="p1">_</p>
				<p class="p3">Visa conditions may mean people cannot legally work, access Centrelink, Medicare or access other government assistance. Eligibility requirements for government assistance via the Status Resolution Support Services (SRSS) program are strict and there can be long waiting periods.</p> 
				<p class="p3">For those without a reliable source of alternative income and with no access to formal safety nets, the situation can become very serious, very quickly.</p>

				<p class="p3">We organise referrals and transport assistance and support people to address their health needs.</p>

					<ul>
						<li class="p4">Food packages to individuals and families who would otherwise go hungry in Western Australia.</li>
						<li class="p4">Donated household setup goods for a family in need or a refurbished bicycle to help an asylum seeker to be independent, self-reliant and healthy in Victoria.</li>
						<li class="p4">Cooking classes and gardening workshops to help with budgeting and healthy eating in South Australia.</li>
						<li class="p4">Transport vouchers to access English classes to help engage people in their communities in Northern Territory.</li>
						<li class="p4">Engaging dentists to donate their time to ensure dental health, or providing donated winter clothing, blankets and toys to children and families in New South Wales.</li>

				<h2>Even with work rights, <br>people still face barriers</h2>
				<p class="p1">_</p>
				<p class="p4">A number of people we supported through emergency relief indicated that they were experiencing work-related issues. Issues ranged from labour exploitation concerns to help obtaining employment separation certificates.</p>
				<p class="p3">For these reasons people can be at risk of becoming involved in unsafe work and exploitative relationships with employers exposing them to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="p4">unpaid or underpaid work;</li>
						<li class="p4">lengthy hours; and</li>
						<li class="p4">poor or unsafe work conditions.</li>
					</ul>
				<p class="p1">_</p>
				<p class="p3">Red Cross also supported people with referrals to trafficking support services.</p> 
				<p class="p3">Even with the right to work, migrants experience specific barriers to obtaining and maintaining their employment. Discrimination, difficulties having prior experience or education recognised, including a reluctance to hire people without local experience can be frustrating for people who are motivated to work.</p>
				<p class="p3">Denial of, or changes to, work rights and barriers to the employment market leads to reliance on income support payments and the charitable sector. The current amount of income support, 89 percent of an equivalent Centrelink benefit, situates people below the poverty line. As well as providing an income, work builds a person’s independence, provides stability and promotes participation in the community.</p>

  			</div> 			
			<div class="art3 col-3">
				<h2>Participation Barriers</h2>
				<p class="p1">_</p>
				<p class="p4">The main barriers encountered, include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="p4">No formal recognition of qualifications gained, training or education achieved outside of Australia</li>
						<li class="p4">Inconsistent government policy on work rights</li>
						<li class="p4">Temporary visa conditions</li>
						<li class="p4">Lack of previous work experience in Australia</li>
						<li class="p4">Limited social connections that can link to potential employers</li>
						<li class="p4">Trauma (including post-traumatic stress), physical incapacity and mental health issues</li>
						<li class="p4">Carer duties/lack of extended family network</li>
						<li class="p4">Preventative cost of child care</li>
						<li class="p4">Language barriers</li>
						<li class="p4">Limited knowledge of recruitment channels</li>
						<li class="p4">Discrimination in recruitment or by employers</li>
						<li class="p4">Earlier immigration policy that prevented many people from working for several years</li>
						<li class="p4">Misinformation in the sector about who can legally work in Australia.</li>
					</ul>
				<p class="p1">_</p>
				<p class="p3">The Federal Government decision to grant work rights to most people living in the community, including people who arrived after 12 August 2012, was a welcome decision. However, many people have spent the last several years unemployed due to ineligibility to work, effectively limiting their capacity to gain local work experience. Many have had minimal access to English language classes — which has further compounded the barriers they face in attaining work.</p>

				<h2>Barriers to food security</h2>
				<p class="p1">_</p>				
				<p class="p4">Red Cross works with communities, governments and networks with other partners to promote better access to healthy food.</p>
				<p class="p3">We know that the largest barriers to community food security are systemic and structural issues such as inadequate access to appropriate housing and income, and Red Cross is committed to focusing its work on addressing the underlying issues that contribute to food insecurity.</p>
				<p class="p3">Making food affordable is not just about being low-cost or cost–effective. It is both the ability to pay without suffering hardship and to be able to purchase at an adequate level to meet individual or household needs. In this context, food items are considered affordable if the individual can afford to meet all their basic living costs after purchase.<br></p>

				<p class="p4">Through our Emergency Relief program, Red Cross is aware of the following personal and structural barriers that can impact on a person’s food security:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="p4">Finite resources of charitable organisations and increase in requested emergency relief services.</li>
						<li class="p4">Access to and availability of culturally or religiously appropriate food.</li>
						<li class="p4">Cost of household bills, particularly utility bills (non-residents cannot access concessions to help with the cost of household bills).</li>
						<li class="p4">Lack of money</li>
						<li class="p4">Proximity to fresh, cheap food sources</li>
						<li class="p4">A departure from traditional diets</li>
						<li class="p4">Transport accessibility (public transport or access to a vehicle) and the ability to physically access food.</li>
						<li class="p4">Level of involvement with cultural, or other, community networks.</li>
						<li class="p4">Feelings of disempowerment at relying on support.</li>
						<li class="p4">Capacity and skills to grow food at home (lack of space or lack of agricultural knowledge).</li>
						<li class="p4">Reluctance to take food that may be needed by people whose situations are even more extreme.</li>
					</ul>
				<p class="p4">Alongside our Emergency Relief Program, Red Cross works to create local partnerships and initiatives to support food security for people in need.</p>

				<h2>Local Initiatives</h2>
				<p class="p1">_</p>
				<p class="p4">In South Australia Red Cross provides Emergency Relief food vouchers to people on a monthly basis to help with groceries and toiletries, as well as providing cooking classes and gardening workshops to help with budgeting and access to healthy food. This group is mainly based in the Northern Suburbs of Adelaide.</p>
				<p class="p3">To broaden the value of assistance provided, the SA MSP team is currently negotiating the purchase of prepaid vouchers from Aldi in recognition that food purchased from other outlets can cost up to three times as much. This will enable people to get better value whilst maintaining the same quality for their dollar, decreasing the need to go without vital necessities.</p>
				<p class="p3">The Welcome Bag is an initiative of the Red Cross’ Migrant Support Services (MSP New South Wales), intended to provide a staple food package which is nutritionally-balanced and non-perishable to new MSP clients. This package has been specifically designed to improve migrants’ awareness of affordable healthy food options, educate about food sustainability on a low-budget and cater to migrants’ nutritional needs in a culturally sensitive manner.</p>

				<p class="pstandout2"><br><br>&#147;While in the community awaiting the outcome of their asylum claim, people are often coping with culture shock, language and cultural barriers, finances are often tight, anxiety is high and they are highly vulnerable to food insecurity. They face episodes of limited food availability, and turn to emergency food relief. They also experience health issues compounded by poorer eating habits within an unfamiliar food landscape.&#148;</p>

					<ul>
						<li class="p4">The Red Cross Emergency Relief program provided support to 259&nbsp;people experiencing medical issues. Depending on the health need, support can take the form of referrals to specialists, meeting the costs of essential medications or chemist vouchers.</li>
						<li class="p4">Sixty-three percent of people seeking health-related support were people seeking protection awaiting an application for government support, 30% were people seeking protection on a return pathway and 7&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent were migrants who were ineligible for Commonwealth assistance.</li>
						<li class="p4">Eighty-five percent of people seeking support reported that in order to meet the costs of managing their medical needs they were struggling to meet the costs of utilities and other bills, public transport, or rent. </li>
						<li class="p4">Eighty percent of people reported that they were unable to financially manage their health issues independently.</li>
						<li class="p4">One in three people were seeking support for concerns regarding their mental health.</li>

				<h2>Barriers to Health Care</h2>
				<p class="p1">_</p>
				<p class="p4">Access to health services is a particular issue for migrants in transition, due to a number of barriers:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="p4">Not all people are able to access Medicare while their visa application is being determined.</li>
						<li class="p4">Although primary health needs are typically met by state and territory governments, it is the out-of-hospital health care costs, such as rehabilitation or ongoing medications, that are generally not covered.</li>
						<li class="p4">People are ineligible for a Heath Care Card, so often face significant financial difficulties meeting out-of-pocket expenses for items like pharmaceuticals, pathology and specialist treatment.</li>
						<li class="p4">People living with chronic health problems can find that their health needs cannot be adequately managed due to prohibitive costs.</li>
						<li class="p4">The out-of-pocket expenses for people who do have Medicare benefits can still be prohibitive due to the high risk of poverty in this group.</li>
						<li class="p4">There are community based organisations providing health clinics for people without Medicare rights, but these typically do not have the resources to meet the demand.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
				<p class="p4">Vulnerable migrants can be affected by distinct health inequalities that arise from their experiences both prior to arrival in Australia and after arrival. Red Cross knows that vulnerable migrants can experience one or more of the following patient or provider barriers that impedes good health or access to appropriate health support:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="p4">Stigma associated with psychosocial problems</li>
						<li class="p4">Social and cultural norms</li>
						<li class="p4">Language</li>
						<li class="p4">Cost of health services</li>							
						<li class="p4">Experiences of discrimination</li>
						<li class="p4">Very restricted physical/mental health supports for people on return pathways</li>
						<li class="p4">Ineligibility for disability services</li>
						<li class="p4">Ineligibility for aged-care residential services</li>
						<li class="p4">Many services will not see clients without a health care card/Medicare</li>
						<li class="p4">Lack of knowledge of specific migrant issues and needs</li>
						<li class="p4">Lack of awareness about thresholds and eligibility for services</li>
						<li class="p4">Interpreting availability</li>
